              <p className="mb-4">
                'Personal data' is information about individuals or information from which individuals can be
                identified. We've set out below the broad categories of the personal data that we process in connection
                with the Services.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">User account information:</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Services are used by entities, natural persons, rightsholders, representatives of rightsholders,
                creators, and internet platforms on which audio, visual, and/or audio-visual work (Content) is
                displayed.

                In the course of contracting with these customers and granting them (or employees acting on their
                behalf) access to the Services, we collect the following personal data:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Contact details: name, email address, job title, company the user works for.</li>

                <li>Correspondence: any information a user provides to us when they communicate with us.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Where we contract with a company, and you are a user accessing the Services on its behalf, we may either
                collect this information from you directly or from the company that employs you.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Platform visitor information:</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In the course of operating the Services we collect the following personal data in connection with
                individuals that use our customers' platforms:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Content usage information: IP address, and information in connection with Content consumed, including
                  what Content is consumed and for how long and/or which parts of Content are consumed.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Due diligence information:</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As part of our due diligence processes when contracting with new customers we may need to carry out some
                "Know Your Customer" (KYC) and "Know Your Business" (KYB) checks. We use a specialist third party
                providers to carry out these checks. Third party KYC/KYB providers are independently responsible for the
                processing of any personal data they use or collect in carrying out these checks. We simply receive a
                notification that you (or the company you work for if you are an employee of one of our customers) has
                passed or failed these checks. Lastly, if you are an individual rightsholder, the fact that you have or
                have not passed these checks will constitute your personal data.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Rightsholder information:</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Services facilitate the regulation of Content on online platforms. To do this, we need to collect
                information on who the rightsholders of that Content are (for example, information on who created,
                featured in, and owns the Content). The rights landscape in respect of Content is complex and there can
                be multiple rightsholders in respect of any one piece of Content. Where rightsholders are individuals,
                this information will constitute personal data.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If our customer is a company that a rightsholder has appointed to represent them and manage their
                Content and/or associated rights, we collect this information from that company. In some cases, we may
                collect rightsholder information from other trusted database sources. If you are an individual
                rightsholder with whom we contract directly, we collect your personal data directly from you.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Platform Content usage information:</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Services process information about the use of Content on internet platforms, which is used to enable
                rightsholders and platforms to calculate and account for royalties, licensing fees, monitor, identify,
                or analyze Content in respect of that use. Where this information is linked back to an individual
                rightsholder, this will constitute personal data.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Similarly, where this information relates to individual users of customer platforms, this will
                constitute personal data. Please see the 'What personal data do we collect?' section above for a
                description of personal data collected in connection with such Content usage.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Information on Content use is collected by technology incorporated in the Services working in
                partnership with the internet Platforms on which Content is displayed.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Prospective customers' data:</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As part of our marketing campaigns from time to time we may identify potential customers and process
                their contact details to inform them of the Services or other services we believe may be of interest to
                them. If you don't want to receive marketing from us, you can let us know at any time by contacting us

                Some of our customers are individuals based in the UK and EEA. To comply with data protection laws that

                We may disclose personal data to our service providers who need to process personal data to provide
                those services to us. Currently, we use a third-party data hosting provider, Microsoft Azure, to store
                data on our behalf. Azure's servers are based in the USA and overseas, and we rely on Microsoft's
                security arrangements for the security of data transfers.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We may from time to time engage other third-party service providers to act on our behalf. Where we do,

                any due diligence that we deem necessary before disclosing any personal data to them in accordance with

                We are a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, although we operate internationally.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We take steps to ensure personal data is protected irrespective of where in the world it is processed or
                transferred.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Where we process personal data of individuals based in the UK and EEA, by law we are required to ensure
                that they are afforded equivalent protection in respect of their personal data as they have in the
                country in which they are based. On a practical level this means that when we transfer personal data
                outside a country which is deemed to have an "adequate" data protection regime by the European
                Commission or UK government, we will put in place appropriate safeguards to protect personal data, such
                as contractual and other supplementary measures.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Data protection law also allows us to make transfers of personal data internationally without putting in
                place additional safeguards in certain, specific, limited situations, such as where the transfer is
                necessary for a contract with the individual concerned or a contract which is in the individual's
                interests. The sharing of rightsholder information and platform Content usage information with customers
                and platforms which is necessary to facilitate licensing falls within that scope.

                information. We will retain this information if it is necessary for the purpose of facilitating
